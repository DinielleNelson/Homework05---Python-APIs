Trend One
  When approaching the equator, the temparture does get warmer, but not in a linear fashion. It is exponential and can quickly vary as 
  the latitude becomes more extreme.
  
Trend Two
  While it may become warmer near equator, humidity does not correspond. Hot climates to tent to be high in humidity, but it can be just
  as humid in cool climates. In fact the most latitutedes tend to be more humid than not.

Trend Three
  Cloudiness is interesting as it should be related to humidity, but it does not reflect very similarly. Cloudiness seems to trend not 
  on latitude at all. But it does show a tendency for extremes, that most locations are nearly to 0% or 90%. 
 
Further Questions
  I would be curious to see the connection of these observations to presence of landmass versus open ocean, rather than latitude.
